# PugTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.2.

## Needs
Angular 6+ is needed for the correct use of Pug. Don't forget to update your global Angular CLI.
The proyect need to execute this command: ng add ng-cli-pug-loader
And, in packaje.json -> scripts add this scripts: 
	"pug-it": "pug src",
	"pug-it:w": "pug src -P -w"

After all of this you wil can use your.component.pug instead of  your.component.html.  

When you complete everything here, you'll be able to use all pug directives powered with Angular
